# GoDDD [![wercker status](https://app.wercker.com/status/4622d397d47d1fa763372d7772722603/s/master "wercker status")](https://app.wercker.com/project/bykey/4622d397d47d1fa763372d7772722603)

This is an attempt to port the [DDD Sample App](http://dddsample.sourceforge.net/) to Go. The purpose is to explore how to write idiomatic Go applications using Domain-Driven Design.

I will update this README along the way, as I gain more insights. Therefore, the implementation may be different from the information in this document.

This project is __not__ intended as a tutorial or guide on how to do DDD in Go. It is meant to be a learning experience.

## Design

The purpose of this sample is because I wanted to learn Go and to see how well it can be used with Domain Driven Design. When faced with design challenges, I will lean towards the more idiomatic solution.
