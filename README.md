This is an attempt to port the [DDD Sample App](http://dddsample.sourceforge.net/) to Go. The purpose is to explore how to write idiomatic Go applications using Domain-Driven Design. The purpose of this sample is because I wanted to learn Go and to see how well it can be used with Domain Driven Design. When faced with design challenges, I will lean towards the more idiomatic solution.

_NOTE: This project is **not** intended as a tutorial or guide on how to do DDD in Go. It is meant to be a learning experience._
