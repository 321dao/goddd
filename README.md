This is an attempt to port the [DDD Sample App](http://dddsample.sourceforge.net/) to Go. The purpose is to explore how to write idiomatic Go applications using Domain-Driven Design. The purpose of this sample is because I wanted to learn Go and to see how well it can be used with Domain Driven Design. 

This project is **not** intended as a tutorial or guide on how to do DDD in Go. It is meant to be a learning experience.

_NOTE: When I set out to do this port, I was in the beginning of the journey to learn Go and so I more or less ported the code directly from the Java-version. Because of this, even though I set out to make the port as idiomatic as I could, the original design is still very much influenced by the Java way. I will try to start refactoring towards a more idiomatic design but until then, please don't pay too much attention to the code._
